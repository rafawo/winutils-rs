# winutils-rs
Rust abstractions of random Windows API and definitions

## Overview

This project is a collection of Rust abstractions of random Windows API and definitions. This crate will slowly grow as time goes by.

The main reason this crate exists is to have a common crate that [virtdisk-rs](https://github.com/rafawo/virtdisk-rs) and [hcs-rs](https://github.com/rafawo/hcs-rs) crates can use to share windows utilities and definitions.
